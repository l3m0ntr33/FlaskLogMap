# FlaskLogMap  
## Just a short readme, will be completed soon

Get the code and just install Python Flask.

Make symbolics links to your SQLite3 database files you want to use in the dbrep repository. Database must be in the format made by PyLogParser tool because actually the field used for request on dates is hardcoded (insert_time).

Just launch run.py and connect to your localhost on port 5000.

Go to configure panel, click on DB file select list form to update the others select list forms and be able to select all needed fields and submit.

## Improvements and cleaning of the code will coming soon
